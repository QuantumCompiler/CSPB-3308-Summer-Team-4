#### Vision Statement
  To take raw ingredients as input and provide recipes that will use those desired ingredents. Utilizing an API to gather these recicpes will allow us to create algortihms to help select desired recipes and present them to the user. 

#### Motivation 
  To help find recipes that use specific ingredients. 
  This would be useful if you want to use particular ingredients that are on sale, about to expire, or that you already have at home. 
  Doing this it will help prevent waste and inspire variety in meals. 


#### Risks
<Risks to project completion, possibly including:
new language or working environment
no prior experience working with these team members
lack of some needed resources>


#### Mitigation
Mitigation Strategy for above risks

#### Development Method
We are going to choose a kanban development method. This agile approach will work for us due to the continuous iteration on adding features and refining the product for each milestone incrementally. We believe it will be the best way we can tackle such a project where we will have to learn a lot about how to build it, add features to an already working product, and add tests along the way. The kanban method works particularly well with our product since we have very busy schedules and will need to be able to view eachothers completed, currently in progress, and future tasks. This will alow us to more fluidly load balance if needed and ensure that tasks that need to work in conjunction are going to be focused on around the same time.  


#### Project Tracking
Link to Trello: https://trello.com/b/UmIWjXL6/software-development-methods-and-tools-project-team-4

We will track our project through Trello, which is effectively a tool based on Kanban principles. We plan to have a product backlog, sprint backlog, and burndown chart in Trello, each on a separate notecard. We will also have personal notecards to list our tasks for the sprints and our progress on those tasks. We will likely keep a general brainstorming/ ideas notecard as well. 
 
We plan to check and update Trello frequently to stay informed about the details of our team member's progress and to ascertain where we will need to focus more as a team and as individuals.
